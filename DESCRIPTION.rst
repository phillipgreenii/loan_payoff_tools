loan_payoff_tools: Simulates multiple different scenarios in which to payoff loans.
==================================================================

This project is designed to determine the optimal way of paying off multiple loans.
This tool can be used to determine if is better to payoff the smallest loan or
the highest interest rate or any other technique.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install most Python packages is via ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::

  $ easy_install loan_payoff_tools

  Usage
  -----

  TODO: This is a good place to start with a couple of concrete examples of how the package should be used.

  The boilerplate code provides a dummy ``main`` function that prints out the word 'Hello'::

    >> from loan_payoff_tools import main
    >> main()

    When the package is installed via ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` this function will be bound to the ``loan_payoff_tools`` executable in the Python installation's ``bin`` directory (on Windows - the ``Scripts`` directory).
